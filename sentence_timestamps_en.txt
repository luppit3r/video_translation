Start: 0.00, End: 0.32, Sentence: Good morning.
Start: 10.52, End: 11.18, Sentence: Welcome.
Start: 11.18, End: 13.58, Sentence: Today's topic is internal forces in beams.
Start: 13.72, End: 14.58, Sentence: This is part two.
Start: 14.60, End: 23.24, Sentence: In this part I will show you how to draw diagrams of internal forces in straightforward beams and how to do it quickly and efficiently without writing equations.
Start: 24.56, End: 35.38, Sentence: Some professors require writing equations to draw diagrams of internal forces, so you need to make sure whether you need these equations or if you simply have to draw these diagrams and that's it.
Start: 37.38, End: 42.04, Sentence: Without writing equations, diagrams are drawn much faster.
Start: 43.00, End: 52.76, Sentence: So, this is definitely a video aimed also at those people for whom drawing diagrams of internal forces is just the beginning of the task, not its main purpose.
Start: 54.24, End: 55.72, Sentence: Ok, let's get started.
Start: 55.76, End: 56.58, Sentence: First example.
Start: 58.04, End: 64.90, Sentence: I have chosen such a small beam, loaded with a concentrated force of 8 kN and continuous loading of 10 kN per meter.
Start: 66.08, End: 72.08, Sentence: In this video, I'll try to draw diagrams on the fly using these powerpoint tools.
Start: 72.08, End: 74.54, Sentence: I hope it will turn out fairly aesthetically.
Start: 78.52, End: 82.38, Sentence: Well, so, I marked the ranges A, B, C, D at the top.
Start: 82.68, End: 107.02, Sentence: And we need to know that in the non-displaceable hinge support we have two reactions horizontal component and vertical component, VC and HC, and when we look at the beam we see that there are no horizontal forces on this beam, so the horizontal component of this VC reaction will be equal to 0, because there is no force that it could absorb here.
Start: 107.64, End: 116.56, Sentence: And here is the sliding hinge support, reaction perpendicular to the direction of sliding with the value of VC.
Start: 118.30, End: 127.86, Sentence: And now we can create the sum of moments with respect to point A, or the sum of moments with respect to point C.
Start: 127.92, End: 138.66, Sentence: Always consider which equation would be best to make, because we could also make a sum of projections on the Y-axis, only in this equation there will be two unknowns, VA and VC.
Start: 139.32, End: 144.60, Sentence: And if we make the sum of moments, we can immediately calculate one of these reactions.
Start: 144.86, End: 176.02, Sentence: I chose the sum of moments at point A, which is 8 times 2 minus VC times 4, and also here we will make the resultant from the continuous load, which is in the center of gravity, and its value is the value of the continuous load, i.e., 10 times the length of the beam, how much this load is on, so 10 times 4 is 40, and this resultant is in the center of gravity, and as it is a rectangle, it is simply halfway.
Start: 179.32, End: 187.94, Sentence: So 8 times 2 minus VC times 4 plus 40, and here is so, two here and another 4, so times 6.
Start: 189.52, End: 204.48, Sentence: Equals 0, from this VC comes out to me 64 kN, and now the sum of projections on the Y axis also equals 0, so we have VA minus 8 plus this VC, which we have already calculated, 64, minus 40 equals 0.
Start: 205.22, End: 218.14, Sentence: From this VA comes out to me 64, and just like in the previous video, where I did it at the end, I change the sign here to positive and turn the VA reaction in the opposite direction.
Start: 218.60, End: 228.10, Sentence: So this VA reaction is indeed 16 in value, but not in this direction, but not this turn, which I marked up, but down.
Start: 228.22, End: 231.34, Sentence: So this VA reaction is 16, but down.
Start: 233.40, End: 237.58, Sentence: Ok, and now that we have the reaction, we can draw the diagrams.
Start: 239.52, End: 241.58, Sentence: Oh, we could also do a check.
Start: 241.62, End: 244.58, Sentence: I did a check here as the sum of the moments at point B.
Start: 245.66, End: 255.96, Sentence: It's a good idea to do a check at a point where no calculated reaction passes, so that both reactions would be included in the check.
Start: 256.56, End: 269.18, Sentence: So we have minus 16 times 2, which is VA times 2, minus VC, which is minus 64 times 2, plus 40 times 4, equals 0, left equals right, it's correct.
Start: 269.76, End: 272.34, Sentence: And now we can draw the diagrams.
Start: 272.48, End: 275.28, Sentence: So I prepared a field for drawing diagrams.
Start: 275.40, End: 282.08, Sentence: Usually this is done just under the beam, but I have it a bit different here.
Start: 282.10, End: 285.12, Sentence: And now we have a few rules.

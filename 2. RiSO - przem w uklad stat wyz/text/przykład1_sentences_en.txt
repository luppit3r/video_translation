Start: 0.00, End: 5.00, Sentence: Welcome warmly. Today's topic is stretching and axial compression.
Start: 5.00, End: 8.00, Sentence: Displacement in statically determinate systems.
Start: 8.00, End: 11.00, Sentence: I have prepared three examples for today.
Start: 11.00, End: 17.00, Sentence: The first one involves calculating the cross-section of rod D and the deformation Delta L.
Start: 17.00, End: 23.00, Sentence: We are given the dimensions of this rod frame system.
Start: 23.00, End: 28.00, Sentence: And all forces and moments acting on it.
Start: 28.00, End: 37.00, Sentence: Notice that calculating the diameter of the rod, and once we calculate the diameter we will look at supports.
Start: 37.00, End: 43.00, Sentence: So, here we have a hinged, non-restrained support, which has 2 reactions.
Start: 43.00, End: 48.00, Sentence: Vertical and horizontal. And we have a reaction in the rod.
Start: 48.00, End: 52.00, Sentence: In this task, we are actually only interested in that reaction in the rod.
Start: 53.00, End: 61.00, Sentence: So, we can calculate the sum of moments about point A, with respect to the hinge support here.
Start: 61.00, End: 68.00, Sentence: And then one unknown in this equation will be that reaction in the rod.
Start: 68.00, End: 75.00, Sentence: To do this, to sum moments at that point, we need the moment arm of each force.
Start: 75.00, End: 78.00, Sentence: Now let’s look at those forces in this system.
Start: 78.00, End: 87.00, Sentence: The forces A P are visible, and the moment arm of the force, with respect to point A, is the shortest, that is, the perpendicular distance from the direction of the force.
Start: 87.00, End: 93.00, Sentence: The direction of action is like an extension toward point A.
Start: 93.00, End: 102.00, Sentence: So if we extended the direction of force P, the shortest, or the perpendicular distance which is the moment arm is here.
Start: 102.00, End: 105.00, Sentence: So, it is A, as you can see.
Start: 105.00, End: 113.00, Sentence: And now, continuous loading can be reduced to the resultant at the center of gravity.
Start: 113.00, End: 116.00, Sentence: The center of gravity of a rectangle is simply in the middle.
Start: 116.00, End: 126.00, Sentence: So the moment arm of this continuous loading would be like half of 2A, which is A, and also here 2A to that point.
Start: 126.00, End: 133.00, Sentence: So we have that as well. The moment does not act on any arm, we just take it into the moment equation.
Start: 133.00, End: 138.00, Sentence: And now this reaction, it is the reaction in the rod, it represents 2 si of the rod.
Start: 138.00, End: 143.00, Sentence: And here the distance is not so obvious anymore.
Start: 143.00, End: 150.00, Sentence: It's good to transfer this here from these 2, to make 2 right triangles.
Start: 150.00, End: 156.00, Sentence: It looks like this, and based on that I will calculate that distance.
Start: 156.00, End: 161.00, Sentence: Using the sine, cosine of these right triangles.
Start: 169.00, End: 172.00, Sentence: So, that’s it.
Start: 172.00, End: 177.00, Sentence: In the sum of moments about A, it results in 0.
Start: 177.00, End: 182.00, Sentence: And the equation will look like this, and now as I told you.
Start: 182.00, End: 188.00, Sentence: And now we assume that the twist law with respect to point A generates positive moments.
Start: 188.00, End: 193.00, Sentence: The twist law. Force P would twist us left-handed.
Start: 193.00, End: 197.00, Sentence: And here it’s at arm A, so minus per A.
Start: 197.00, End: 206.00, Sentence: Now we add, and we reduce the continuous loading to the resultant at the center of gravity, and this is the value of the continuous loading and the length.
Start: 206.00, End: 209.00, Sentence: The line where this continuous load lies.
Start: 209.00, End: 213.00, Sentence: So, it's about 2a and this is 2k, it will create a positive.
Start: 213.00, End: 217.00, Sentence: Looking like the run on A.
Start: 217.00, End: 224.00, Sentence: On the arm 3a, which is half of those 2a that it weighs, meaning this center of gravity and another 2a is the arm 3a.
Start: 224.00, End: 229.00, Sentence: And now minus S. Minus S and times this arm.
Start: 229.00, End: 232.00, Sentence: Now, where did I get this arm from? Exactly from these triangles.
Start: 232.00, End: 242.00, Sentence: If we write down that here is theta prime, which represents that length, then theta prime to 2a is the sine of this angle, that is, the sine of 60.
Start: 242.00, End: 245.00, Sentence: So theta prime is 2a times sine 60.
Start: 245.00, End: 253.00, Sentence: If we assumed that length as theta double prime, then theta double prime to 2a is the cosine of this angle, that is, cosine 60.
Start: 253.00, End: 261.00, Sentence: Or sine 30, however that is the same value. So theta double prime is 2a times cosine 60.
Start: 261.00, End: 266.00, Sentence: And this whole length is theta prime plus theta double prime, which is written here in the notes.
Start: 266.00, End: 271.00, Sentence: Ok, we want to calculate our unknown, which is the reaction in the arm, that is S.
Start: 271.00, End: 276.00, Sentence: So we move S with the brackets to the other side, dividing by those brackets.
Start: 276.00, End: 280.00, Sentence: We can, of course, swap myself around.
Start: 280.00, End: 291.00, Sentence: And we substitute numerical values, that is, P was given, A was 1 meter and all the data was presented in the task.
Start: 291.00, End: 300.00, Sentence: So plugging in those sines, also cosines, we get that S equals 9800 kilonewtons.
Start: 301.00, End: 308.00, Sentence: My forces P, M and K were substituted as stated in the task, so in kilonewtons, the result is in kilonewtons.
Start: 308.00, End: 313.00, Sentence: If I converted to newtons, that is, to the basic unit, it would have been in newtons.
Start: 313.00, End: 317.00, Sentence: But I didn't do that, it's in kilonewtons.
Start: 317.00, End: 321.00, Sentence: And having already the force in the arm, we can dimension it.
Start: 321.00, End: 329.00, Sentence: That is, dimensioning the arm with the conditions of strength, stress, that is the value of stress to the condition,
Start: 329.00, End: 336.00, Sentence: of strength, we take as absolute value, because as we know, stress will be either tensile or compressive.
Start: 336.00, End: 340.00, Sentence: The force in the arm came out positive, so the arm will be elongated.
Start: 340.00, End: 346.00, Sentence: We always take the force as if to the intersection, we cut this system and here to the intersection is this force S.
Start: 346.00, End: 352.00, Sentence: If it is positive, then the arm is elongated. If it is negative, then the arm is compressed.
Start: 352.00, End: 356.00, Sentence: Thus, our arm in this system is elongated because the force came out positive.
Start: 356.00, End: 360.00, Sentence: As we already know that it is elongated, we take the strength for tension.
Start: 360.00, End: 368.00, Sentence: But if it were compressed, we wouldn't take it here since the force value came out negative, but we don't take it with a minus,
Start: 368.00, End: 371.00, Sentence: we only take it as a positive absolute value. That's why I wrote it down like this.
Start: 371.00, End: 376.00, Sentence: We have it, this is it, but that's how it looks.
Start: 376.00, End: 382.00, Sentence: So the force is positive, the arm is elongated, meaning we take it for the strength for tension.
Start: 382.00, End: 385.00, Sentence: So, the force is the area of the cross-section.
Start: 385.00, End: 394.00, Sentence: Cross-sections with a circular shape, the area of the circular section is recorded as the area of a circle, and this is the square of the diameter.
Start: 394.00, End: 402.00, Sentence: But when we take the diameter, it's the square of another diameter, so it's the fourth square diameter.
Start: 402.00, End: 406.00, Sentence: And I often use this, even for strength calculations.
Start: 407.00, End: 413.00, Sentence: Writing such a cross-section with the diameter, which is the fourth square diameter.
Start: 413.00, End: 421.00, Sentence: The fourth diameter force in a bar of 98x9x3, the highest basic unit.
Start: 421.00, End: 425.00, Sentence: The tensile strength for this task is 80 megapascals.
Start: 425.00, End: 431.00, Sentence: So we can record from this formula, which is force divided by the area of the cross-section,
Start: 431.00, End: 437.00, Sentence: as the motion equation, that 80 megapascals, which equals times 10x6.
Start: 437.00, End: 443.00, Sentence: We transform it, so here the square diameter seems to multiply by the inverse,
Start: 443.00, End: 446.00, Sentence: so the four moves up.
Start: 446.00, End: 455.00, Sentence: We multiply before by 80x10x6, by the square, standard mathematical transformations.
Start: 455.00, End: 464.00, Sentence: From this, we find that the diameter must be greater than or equal to 125x8 meters,
Start: 464.00, End: 467.00, Sentence: because everything was in basic units.
Start: 467.00, End: 471.00, Sentence: If we move the numbers two times to the right or multiply by 100,
Start: 471.00, End: 479.00, Sentence: we get in centimeters, so the diameter must be greater than or equal to 1.25 centimeters.
Start: 480.00, End: 486.00, Sentence: Having the diameter already dimensioned, we can calculate the elongation of the bar.
Start: 486.00, End: 490.00, Sentence: The elongation of the bar formula states that elongation is the force in the bar,
Start: 490.00, End: 494.00, Sentence: times the length of the bar divided by the Young's modulus times the area of the cross-section.
Start: 497.00, End: 500.00, Sentence: The area reminds me of the square diameter.
Start: 500.00, End: 506.00, Sentence: Our value will be greater than or equal to 125, we can assume rounding gently up,
Start: 506.00, End: 509.00, Sentence: that it is 1.30 dm.
Start: 511.00, End: 515.00, Sentence: So I substituted it here, it is in centimeters,
Start: 515.00, End: 518.00, Sentence: and if I want the result in basic units,
Start: 518.00, End: 521.00, Sentence: so we will go back to meters, I can write it as,
Start: 521.00, End: 523.00, Sentence: as times 10 to the minus second.
Start: 523.00, End: 526.00, Sentence: And this diameter has to be squared, so it's recorded that way.
Start: 526.00, End: 531.00, Sentence: The result comes out in square meters, because I set it for basic units.
Start: 532.00, End: 538.00, Sentence: The Young's modulus for this task was 2 times 10 to the 5 megapascals,
Start: 538.00, End: 543.00, Sentence: so 2 times 10 to the 5 times 10 to the 6, which equals 2 times 10 to the 11.
Start: 545.00, End: 549.00, Sentence: And the calculated force in the bar is 98 times 10 to the 3,
Start: 549.00, End: 552.00, Sentence: already recorded in basic units of Newtons
Start: 552.00, End: 556.00, Sentence: and everything in basic units is the base for the formula.
Start: 557.00, End: 559.00, Sentence: And it comes out.
Start: 559.00, End: 563.00, Sentence: On the calculator, we substitute basic units,
Start: 563.00, End: 567.00, Sentence: we get the result in basic units, which is in meters, the elongation,
Start: 567.00, End: 570.00, Sentence: which is 3.80 dm. with 4,
Start: 570.00, End: 574.00, Sentence: as multiplying by 10 to the 3 will give the result in millimeters,
Start: 574.00, End: 579.00, Sentence: which would be 3.80 dm. to 1 millimeter.
Start: 579.00, End: 582.00, Sentence: and if I move the insert to the left once again,
Start: 582.00, End: 584.00, Sentence: so that it’s not 10 to 1,
Start: 584.00, End: 588.00, Sentence: it will simply be 48 millimeters.
Start: 588.00, End: 590.00, Sentence: And we have calculated it.
Start: 590.00, End: 592.00, Sentence: We calculated, we measured the speed
Start: 592.00, End: 596.00, Sentence: and we calculated its performance,
Start: 596.00, End: 600.00, Sentence: which is everything the task asks of us.
